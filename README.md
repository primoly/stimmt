**This is still early work in progress and should not be used.**

Realtime querying the results of Swiss federal popular votes (referendums and initiatives).

**TODO:**

- Check which fields can be `null` in JSON and make them `Option`s.
- Improve types in general.
- Remove redundant fields and turn them into methods.
- Add cantonal popular votes.
- Can the URL of the latest popular votes be queried somehow?
- Add documentation and rename fields.
- â€¦
