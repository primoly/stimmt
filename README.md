**This is still early work in progress and should not be used.**

Realtime querying the results of Swiss federal popular votes (referendums and initiatives).

**TODO:**

- Check which fields can be `null` in JSON and make them `Option`s.
- Improve types in general.
- Improve error handling.
- Remove redundant fields and turn them into methods.
- Add documentation and rename fields.
- Invalid votes and turnout are calculated incorrectly.
- Add geo data support https://opendata.swiss/de/dataset/geodaten-zu-den-eidgenoessischen-abstimmungsvorlagen
- â€¦
